	<p>Ryan’s “Is Ryan At The Office” project is exactly what I had in mind when I started putting together I Had Ten Dollars. It’s utility is questionable at best. Ryan goes to the office pretty frequently. Like, basically five-days-a-week often. His commute is something like two hours so if you wanted an estimate of when he was going to get home it wouldn’t give you a really useful range to work with. I don’t get the impression that it was built because Ryan wanted it to exist, but that it exists because Ryan wanted to build something. And for all that, I kind of love it. When I moved to Seattle I would sit in my office at a job I kind of hated and check IsRyanAtTheOffice and feel a little more connected to my friend. Sometimes his status would be at work pretty late and I wold tell him to go home. It was a really small interaction and it feels kind of silly because it’s not a stand-in for communication by any means, but I think it’s basically impossible to make something without a little of youreself coming through. So this single page, one word site still made me think, “LOL, Ryan.”</p>

<p>Thanks for being the first interview, Ryan! Questions now.</p>

<h4>Who are you and what do you do?</h4>

<p>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/5000lobsters">Ryan Wolf</a> and I go to an office. I work as a software engineer at Google on their internet book store. I like to look at <a href="http://mlkshk.com/catsiknow">pictures of cats</a> and try to make the world as cute as possible. Send me your pictures of cats, please.</p>

<h4>What does Is Ryan at the Office do?</h4>

<p><a href="http://isryanattheoffice.com">Is Ryan at the Office</a> is a novelty domain that says “yes.” when I am at work,
and “no.” when I am not.</p>

<h4>How’d you get the idea?</h4>

<p>I was using <a href="https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/3001634">Latitude</a> to let my
girlfriend know whether I was staying late at work or not. I ragequit Latitude
for some reason that I’m sure made a ton of sense at the time, and needed a
replacement.</p>

<h4>What’s it build with?</h4>

<p>The server is written in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, and runs on <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>.
You can find the source on <a href="http://github.com/thebigbad/novelty.go">GitHub</a>. Try
resizing the window–what little styling there is is Responsive(tm)(.biz)!</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm">Tasker</a>
running on my phone. I’ve asked Tasker to tell the server when I get close to
the cell towers by my office (and when I get far from them again).</p>

<h4>Is there anything you’d like to improve or change?</h4>

<p>App Engine refuses to serve from a “naked” domain, so a micro EC2 instance I’m
using for some other stuff has to redirect to www.isryanattheoffice.com. I’d
like to get rid of that www. Or add even more w’s?</p>

<p>Tasker needs internet access in order to talk to the server. In retrospect, it’s
obvious that “out of cell range” is a signal that happens when I’m away from
cell towers, so it sometimes fails to update to “no.” when I’m on my way home.</p>

<h4>Has it affected your life in any way? Does your girlfriend check it to see if you’re staying late or anything?</h4>

<p>Sometimes Thomas sends me a message because Is Ryan at the Office is out of
date. An unexpected bonus of running this site is a personalized push service:
Is Thomas Fiddling Around on a Computer Dot Com.</p>

<h4>Are you a domain hoarder? What’s the best domain you’ve got sitting idle right now?</h4>

<p>Nope, but something about the “generic” in gTLD has me really excited about
engaging with brands. I believe we are entering a period of domain confusion and
