	<h4>Who are you and what do you do?</h4>

<p>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/5000lobsters">Ryan Wolf</a> and I go to an office. I work as a software engineer at Google on their internet book store. I like to look at <a href="http://mlkshk.com/catsiknow">pictures of cats</a> and try to make the world as cute as possible. Send me your pictures of cats, please.</p>

<h4>What does Is Ryan at the Office do?</h4>

<p><a href="http://isryanattheoffice.com">Is Ryan at the Office</a> is a novelty domain that says &#8220;yes.&#8221; when I am at work,
and &#8220;no.&#8221; when I am not.</p>

<h4>How&#8217;d you get the idea?</h4>

<p>I was using <a href="https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/3001634">Latitude</a> to let my
girlfriend know whether I was staying late at work or not. I ragequit Latitude
for some reason that I&#8217;m sure made a ton of sense at the time, and needed a
replacement.</p>

<h4>What&#8217;s it build with?</h4>

<p>The server is written in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, and runs on <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>.
You can find the source on <a href="http://github.com/thebigbad/novelty.go">GitHub</a>. Try
resizing the window&#8211;what little styling there is is Responsive(tm)(.biz)!</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm">Tasker</a>
running on my phone. I&#8217;ve asked Tasker to tell the server when I get close to
the cell towers by my office (and when I get far from them again).</p>

<h4>Is there anything you&#8217;d like to improve or change?</h4>

<p>App Engine refuses to serve from a &#8220;naked&#8221; domain, so a micro EC2 instance I&#8217;m
using for some other stuff has to redirect to www.isryanattheoffice.com. I&#8217;d
like to get rid of that www. Or add even more w&#8217;s?</p>

<p>Tasker needs internet access in order to talk to the server. In retrospect, it&#8217;s
obvious that &#8220;out of cell range&#8221; is a signal that happens when I&#8217;m away from
cell towers, so it sometimes fails to update to &#8220;no.&#8221; when I&#8217;m on my way home.</p>

<h4>Has it affected your life in any way? Does your girlfriend check it to see if you&#8217;re staying late or anything?</h4>

<p>Sometimes Thomas sends me a message because Is Ryan at the Office is out of
date. An unexpected bonus of running this site is a personalized push service:
Is Thomas Fiddling Around on a Computer Dot Com.</p>

<h4>Are you a domain hoarder? What&#8217;s the best domain you&#8217;ve got sitting idle right now?</h4>

<p>Nope, but something about the &#8220;generic&#8221; in gTLD has me really excited about
engaging with brands. I believe we are entering a period of domain confusion and
