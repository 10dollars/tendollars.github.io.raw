	<h4>How was your weekend of demos?</h4>

<p>It went well. We were the O’Reilly design conference and we won the startup thing. It’s a good start to the week.</p>

<h4>Oh cool. So, you’re looking for funding or to join an incubator right now?</h4>

<p>Yeah, we are currently in an incubator in downtown San Francisco called <a href="http://www.indiebio.co/">Indie Bio</a>. It’s from the same people who run [the hardware acellerator] <a href="https://hax.co/">HAX</a>. Indie Bio one is specifically for biotech and is in its second year, I think. There’s only one or two cohorts before us. There’s a demo day, just like any other incubator, in which we will be pitching in front of investors and that’s in two weeks now. So, we’ve already got some seed funding, but we really need to get more for manufacturing. Hardware is crazy.</p>

<h4>You started this at MIT Media Lab and I’m curious how you got the idea to make this your project.</h4>

<p>Sure. Before joining the Media Lab, I was doing wearable technology. So I studied gold smithing and I was interested and how we can use traditional making, and the traditional aesthetics of jewelry, to make wearable tech more appreciated and more desirable. Because it didn’t really have that a couple of years ago. I joined the lab, and while I was there the Apple Watch was coming out and all those things, so I kind of lost interest in wearable tech because I’d done quite a few projects and they’d been successful, at least in museums and stuff, at bringing the aesthetics and the technology together.</p>

<p>I was looking for something new and I took a class over winter break - “microfluids for synthetic biology”. Everyone told us when you take your winter break class, take something you would never normally do, and that is definitely a class I would never normally do. So I took that and we had a talk from a lady named Natalie Kuldell who started a <a href="http://biobuilder.org/">foundation</a> to teach teachers how to integrate synthetic biology into their curriculum.  She was talking about how you can use cells to create perfume. And one of the things we did was make E. coli smell like banana, and I thought twas was amazing.  I was really into perfume and scent and stuff. And I just that that the fact that I could, as a non-scientist, do this in a couple of days - assemble a genetic circuit and have it actually create something for me was just amazing.</p>

<p>So I took another few workshops. I did one with <a href="http://symbiota.org/docs/symbiota-workshops/">Symbiota</a> where we created a violet pigment that’s actually an anti-cancerous compound. And again, that took two days. And we did it in our lab director’s kitchen eating, and drinking coffee, and doing genetic engineering at the same time. And that was a really powerful. The fact that you don’t actually even need to be in a lab, and can just be in your kitchen and still do this. I was really inspired, and I was really excited. But I was speaking to my other friends at MIT and they were all terrified that I could do bio-engineering. They didn’t quite understand it and were like, “Oh, bioterrorism,” and all that. So I thought that even if very future-thinking people are still afraid - and it’s mostly because they’re not experienced - Some of them eventually did it work shop and once they did it - assembled a circuit that produced a color - they were like, “Okay, I get it.” I thought it would be quite powerful if, similar to how we learn with computers - So once you start programming you kind of get it like oh okay, I can do this. I understand it. And now I understand the whole field better.</p>

<p>I thought I would be the same with genetic engineering and synthetic biology. I thought that if we get more and more people to at least have a basic understanding of it, or a quick experience with it in high school or at home, then they’ll feel more comfortable with the subject. And they can take part in the discussions about the laws and the ethics and decide if they even  want it in their body. And if they don’t that’s fine, but at least it’s their own decision. It’s not the media telling them that they’ll die or things like that.</p>

<h4>I’m curious where you think some of that fear comes from. Is it a fear that hobbyists will make mistakes and unleash some ungodly creation, or is it a fear of premeditated mischief?</h4>

<p>I think it’s definitely both those things. There is a sense that if anyone has access to it then anyone can start making and creating these unexpected creatures, or that people with malicious intentions will use it. If you look back in history, and this is quite apparent with computers, any time there’s a new technology or science that people don’t understand it produces fear. In the eighties people were terrified of computers. And I think it makes sense. It’s much easier to see the dangers of it, and the benefits are sometimes so mundane, but so powerful. Like insulin is kind of a mundane thing that you don’t really think about, but I don’t know how many people rely on it to stay survive. I think it’s more a question of not understanding what’s going on. And when it’s behind closed doors with scientists in lab coats and anything could happen and we don’t really know… I think that’s where it comes from.</p>

<h4>The couple of project examples you gave were just a couple of days, and I was wondering how typical that is for projects? With the apps that Amino ships with, how long would those take to do?</h4>

<p>Well, so the first thing you need to do, especially with the Amino, is to grow the cells that you’re going to transform. To grow them takes 12 hours. We usually recommend doing it overnight. So you put them in in the evening and you have them in the morning.  Then you put the DNA program in. The actual transformation, like you putting the the DNA program in the cells is only a couple of hours. But once it’s in there you need to then wait for the cells to grow again, so that’s another twelve hours. Biology’s a little slow. Then you can put it in the liquid culture, that’s when it’s in the main chamber, and have it grow and start expressing the proteins you want. In total it’s like a 36 hour experiment where you’re not doing much some of the time, you’re just watching it grow. And that’s typical in biology. You need to wait for your cells to grow.</p>

<h4>That’s seems pretty good though. Two days is really not that long to run an experiment, I think. For some reason when I was initially reading about it I thought it would take much longer.</h4>

<p>Yeah, I think kids can still be interested after a couple of days.</p>

<h4>Yeah, how young do you think you would go for an Amino?</h4>

<p>We’ve had workshops where the youngest we’ve had that completely did the workshop and understood what they were doing where like eight and nine years old. They were good at knowing what was going on and participating in the discussion. And then we’ve had their younger siblings, like 5 or 6 years old,   and they can do the experiment, but they just can’t quite understand what they’re doing, which makes sense, because they’re little. In the home context, if you have a younger sibling it would be okay to have a five or six year old do it.  Right now we’re going in through schools and I wouldn’t recommend below eight. Just because you need a lot of concentration to do it.</p>

<h4>What’s the reaction been like from the schools that you’ve been talking to?</h4>
<p>They’re all very excited. But to be quite honest we’ve mostly we’ve mostly spoken to private schools or non-tradition schools with different curriculums. They’ve all been very excited because they don’t actually have access to anything that hands on for teaching bio-technology or synthetic biology. So they’re very excited. And the kit is reusable, so they see it as a good investment. If you imagine when we were younger and the first time we saw computers was in the school computer lab where we are a shared a couple machines. And so they’ve been very excited. We haven’t really been spoken to many public schools. And they’re excited, but on their end there’s more a question of the budget and they have more students per classroom.</p>

<p>I think they’re still excited, but it’s a bit harder to see how we’ll fit in. I’m sure we’ll figure it out once the machine is at a lower cost as well. Right now we’re hand fabricating them, and only in small quantities, which means that all the parts are way more expensive than if we were to do a large run. Once we’re down to a couple hundred then public schools can start and using them. And definitely after school programs for public schools are really interested.</p>

<h4>So the design of it is very pleasant. I was wondering how you decided to use wood for the case. I saw some of the early prototypes had been 3d printed, and it looked like there were some aluminum versions. I was wondering how you settled on the final design for it.</h4>

<p>Yes. Actually, that took way longer than you would expect. When I was designing it, a lot of it was “how do we make it not scary?” How do we make it friendly and enticing enough that kids want to play with it, but also adults want to have it in their home? One of the things we really want to do is allow people, mostly adults probably, to create yeast for brewing and baking. So, with added vitamins and added flavors. So it needs to fit in the home quite well. Not something you’d be ashamed of having, something you’d be quite proud of having. That’s where the wood came from; this idea of homeliness. Something that’s quite warm, both to the eye and the touch. And something that’s as far away from what you imagine a scientific experiment lab looking like, which would probably be aluminum or plastic and all that. I think people when they think of technology, they think of aluminum from their Macbooks and everything. We’re trying to change that first perception. When you see it as a wooden box, you see it as something approachable and that you don’t need a lot of skills or knowledge to use.</p>

<h4>And so I guess if you could describe your ideal outcome from somebody owning an amino. What are you most excited about for having these things in people’s homes.</h4>

<p>One of the things I personally am more excited about is giving non scientists and people who have no interest in science the ability to create using science without having to be a scientist. So I’m really excited for people at home to be able to create their own yeast. that, say, glows in the dark and then making cakes and growing beers from it. Just having that really simple application for something that’s actually super powerful and complex. And I like imaging kids having this as a Christmas present. And, you know, you’re so excited when you get your Christmas gifts. I remember getting a chemistry set and following the instructions for the first few and then being like, “Fuck these instructions, I’m going to make my own.” And most of the time it didn’t work out. But I’m really excited to see kids start trying to create things that we haven’t told them to. It will still be safe because we’re only providing safe chemicals. One of the apps we’re putting out is to create your own pigments that either glows under UV, or can glow in the dark.  I’m sure someone will create a pigment that we’ve never seen before or that changes color over time or something. I think that will be really cool.</p>

<h4>The first app the Amino ships with is to make E. coli grow, is that right? I was talking to some people about the project and mentioned the E. coli nightlight and it seemed like E. coli is a pretty scary one to hear about. Did you have any pushback or worries about that?</h4>

<p>When we started, I really wanted to use yeast  just because it’s much less scary. But developing the pathways to get yeast to do pigments and things like that is a lot more complicated. And actually there’s a hundred strains of E. coli and only 2 or 3 are pathogenic. We already have E. coli in our guts and it’s everywhere and most of it is super safe. It was selected as one of the better candidates to genetically modify. So that’s the one they use in labs. So that’s why we’re using it, because it’s so well known and it’s easy-ish to use.           We’re hoping hoping that by using a platform that’s already well known in the community more people develop their own apps and then get to share them. When we were doing the indiegogo we tried not to say E. coli anywhere, but then people asked and we replied, of course. But yeah, we are well aware that it doesn’t have the best reputation at the moment.</p>

<h4>So the trend for science seems to be that it’s getting more open as other technologies seem like they’re getting more closed or at least more abstracted, and harder to do at home in some ways. It seems like the reason for this is the hardware for the sciences seems to be coming down a bit. I was looking at the sensor comparisons on your site, and I was wondering how you’re able to get those lab quality sensors for so much less or in such a compact form.</h4>

<p>Lab hardware is becoming so much cheaper, but it’s mostly because, now almost everyone who is a hacker/maker is an engineer and they can see what it takes to make a machine run. A centrifuge, for example, is sold for thousands of dollars, but you only need a computer fan motor. You only need a motor that spins at 9,000 RPM, and a little 3D printed holder for your tube. Most of the things we’ve done for the first version of the Amino is break open computer fans and that sort of thing to create the system. And now we have custom sensors, but those sensors are actually modeled on other technologies that are the same as what are being used in science except they’re in our home appliances and they’re much cheaper for it. When you’re in a big lab the equipment needs to be very precise and very reliable, but when you’re doing something like Amino in the home you don’t need that level of precision. We also have a really great mechanical engineer, which really helped in making things cheaper.</p>

<h4>What are some of the differences between something that would need that level of precision and an Amino project.</h4>

<p>Well I guess when you’re dealing with things like medicine or if you’re inventing new pathways it needs to be more precise.  But we’re providing you with existing pathways and we’re providing you with all the reagents so it doesn’t need to be quite as precise.</p>

<h4>What are the other apps you’re planning on releasing.</h4>

<p>The first two are the nightlight and the pigment maker, so you can draw and paint. And then for next year we’re working on yeast so people can brew or bake. And after that, we’ve actually found different ways to create ingredients for cosmetics and perfumes.  So you can produce a scent. Whatever a flower produces you can recreate synthetically. Already rose oil, because it’s so hard to find is being produced synthetically. And vanilla flavors are also being produced synthetically. So that’s for next year. Of course, before we get to something that you can put on your body or ingest we need to do more rigorous testing and we need to talk to the right. government bodies. We really think that the personal bio lab movement will be something very powerful and we want to make sure we do it correctly.  We’d rather go slow and make sure everyone’s safe.  With something like a brewing kit, if you were to make your own yeast, what are some of the things you could do with it. You can change the flavor of it. With baking you can add different flavors to the yeast.   Or you can also add different vitamin content. Like I was talking about vitamin A, you could have your yeast produce vitamin A. Or, if in your family you don’t eat a lot of green veggies you could make it produce vitamin K, all these different components and then you have a good excuse to eat a thousand cakes. You could also do fun things like have it change colors. You could have it glow in the dark. All those different things.</p>

<p>You could explore the bio-sensor realm of synthetic biology. It’s similar to Arduino where you have an actuator and a sensor but on a biology level.  where if the bacteria detects, say, the presence of hight temperature it will change color or smell different and that sort of thing.  That might be really interesting. I don’t know how stable it would be if you were to bake it, but that’s something we’re going to explore.</p>

<p>So the initial ones are going to be shipping in March for backers?</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s super close. We’re actually right on time. I think we’ll be able to ship more than we promised. We were going to do it in too batches, but we might be able to do it a little quicker.  We found that there are still a lot of people want to buy it and we want to look into large scale manufacturing soon, so I think we’ll try to get all those Indiegogo Aminos out as soon as possible and then we’ll look into larger scale manufacturing.</p>

<h4>Because you assembled all of these by hand?</h4>

<p>[Laughs] Yup. We’re still doing that. We’ve actually sorted out a good assembly system. And one of the things I didn’t think about, that one of our team members thought about, was how do you service one. If something breaks or you need to change a part. So that’s one of the things we worked on a lot in the last month: how do you make it so that it’s still safe, it’s still and functional, but  you can easily open it up and change of pump for example if a pump breaks or something.</p>

<p>And I forgot I have like two questions to ask everybody What was the most surprising thing that you learned while making this project?</p>

<p>I think it was that so many people came together to make it happen. I used to work in speculative design where you come up an idea, and you make a prototype, and it goes in a museum, and you give a few talks about it, and everyone’s very proud of you, but nothing happens with it. You know, you put it in your closet or it stays in a gallery.  But this time it’s actually real and friends, and engineers, and scientists helped out. Everyone’s very supportive. The media lab was very supportive. They actually gave us money. Yeah, that part was really amazing.</p>

<h4>And then what was the most challenging part of realizing this project.</h4>

<p>I think we’re going through it right now. It’s going to be really boring answer, but it’s taking it from a prototype that works and turning it into a consumer product that other people can use for a long time. So, our prototype you could have used for like two weeks and then you would have been in trouble. But this version we’re making now, you can use for a year. Yeah, that’s quite a challenge. Of course, if we had unlimited amounts of money we could do that easily and sell it to you for 1500 dollars or thirty grand because the pumps are so expensive, but it was a finding the right balance of quality material and durability.</p>
