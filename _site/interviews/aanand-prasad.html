<h4>Who are you and what do you do (for a living)?</h4>

<p>I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/aanand">Aanand Prasad</a> and I make software for a living. I work at <a href="http://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Compose</a>. Because it’s important for a growing boy to have a diversity of interests, I also make software in my free time.</p>

<h4>What is Slit-Scanner?</h4>

<p>It’s a <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner">Twitter bot</a> which applies a particular visual effect to any animated GIF you send to it. The effect is known variously as “slit-scan” and “rolling shutter” – essentially, you displace each row of a video progressively further forwards or backwards in time:</p>

<p>Frame 1 becomes (row 1 from frame 1) + (row 2 from frame 2) + (row 3 from frame 3) + …
Frame 2 becomes (row 1 from frame 2) + (row 2 from frame 3) + (row 3 from frame 4) + …
…and so on.</p>

<p>This leads to bizarre and quite varied effects, depending on the type of motion in the video. If people or things are moving left and right, they become <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/723158119719809024">transverse</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/723307448380084225">waves</a>. If they’re moving up and down, they become rippling <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/723215092465172480">longitudinal</a> waves, as if they’re underwater. If they’re rotating around a vertical axis, they <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/725100249329598465">become</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/725448146667626501">twisted</a>, which is the weirdest effect of all.</p>

<h4>Where did the idea come from?</h4>

<p>I’d been fascinated by slit-scanning for ages, because I’m extremely cool. I think the earliest form I saw it in was the <a href="http://golembewski.awardspace.com/">Scanner Photography Project</a>. I’d long been a fan of the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTW0rNgMcKk">rolling</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVwmtwZLG88">shutter</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_tm6ECxPmc">propeller</a>” effect – the first time I saw one of those videos, it messed with my sense of reality in a way I’ve rarely felt. <a href="https://twitter.com/shashashasha">Sha Hwang</a> had already created a bookmarklet for <a href="http://shahwang.tumblr.com/post/40481891091/the-fight-scene-from-oldboy">slit-scanning videos in the browser</a> using the “static slit” effect to create a still image, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/7878518">this short film</a> introduced me to the idea of using the “moving slit” effect to create a moving image. Finally, I’d also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/mduZoDR1tY/">experimented</a> a little myself with a slit-scan iPhone app I found on the store.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the idea came to me about half an hour after getting into bed one night, ensuring I’d be incapable of sleep until I’d at least knocked together a basic implementation of the effect.</p>

<h4>How did you build it?</h4>

<p>The same way I build all my bots: copy and paste a load of Python from my other bots into a giant hacky mess. I used thricedotted’s <a href="https://github.com/thricedotted/twitterbot">twitterbot</a> framework, ffmpeg for extracting frames from videos, Pillow for applying the actual effect and ImageMagick for re-assembling the GIF.</p>

<p>I also used <a href="https://github.com/dthpham/butterflow">butterflow</a> for smoothing the video beforehand. Most GIFs have a very low temporal resolution (i.e. number of frames), and that results in big chunky rows rather than smooth ripples, so in the majority of cases I double the frame rate before processing it. This is extremely computationally intensive, and makes the bot very slow, but the quality is worth it.</p>

<h4>What was the biggest challenge making it?</h4>

<p>Keeping it running – smoothing the video needs a lot of memory and it’s running on a pretty small VM, resulting in crashes, prolonged downtime and repeated replies. It’s all part of the bot’s “quirky charm”, much like my own.</p>

<h4>What was the “easiest” part?</h4>

<p>Implementing the actual slit-scanning – it worked almost the first time I ran it, and I was back in bed in no time.</p>

<h4>What was the most surprising thing you learned?</h4>

<p>The sheer variety of ways that slit-scanning can make a moving image weird was a big surprise. I was prepared for some cool rotational GIFs and a few interesting wobbles, but it’s come out with so much more. For example, because the time displacement wraps around, the output is always a looping gif, even if the input isn’t. Slow movement becomes <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/723460616116154368">gentle ripples</a>; slow zooms <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/724394120140173312">become</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/724908713102958592">optical</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/723575690273153024">illusions</a>.</p>

<p>I also love that, with zero knowledge of what’s in the picture, a ridiculously simple 2D transformation can warp 3D objects in a way that feels very convincing, preserving shading and reflections across a virtual surface. Rotational GIFs demonstrate that very well, as do the propeller videos I mentioned before.</p>

<h4>You’ve made a number of bots now, and I was wondering what do you look for in a bot idea/project?</h4>

<p>Firstly, I’ve never had an attention span (I don’t even know what that is), so every creative project is a race against time: I need to be able to implement it before I get bored. I have a sad graveyard of projects that took just a bit too long and got abandoned.</p>

<p>Bot people, at least the ones I associate with, have strong feelings about bot ethics and etiquette. I’ve thrown away a lot of ideas because they’d be potentially rude/invasive, or because there was a high danger that they’d inadvertently generate upsetting content. It is absolutely the responsibility of the creator to guard against this: our software is infused with our cultural norms, and if you care about changing those for the better, you have to care about your software too.</p>

<p>It’s hard to know ahead of time what will take off and what won’t, but that’s definitely a factor too. I really can’t be bothered making something if I think only three people are ever going to look at it. (It feels good to admit this.)</p>

<p>Finally, a project is especially exciting if I think I might learn something along the way. The ideal difficulty level is “just outside my comfort zone”.</p>

<h4>Do you have a favorite slit-scan?</h4>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/slitscanner/status/722768869979484160">Princess Leia turning her head</a>, the image I used for the bot’s avatar. As well as being hypnotically weird and hilarious, I’ve found it to be the best demonstration of what the bot does – people immediately get that time is delayed between the top and bottom of the image.</p>

<h4>What are some of your favorite bots from other people?</h4>

<p>Goodness. I’ll strive to highlight lesser-known works where I can. I’m going to leave out a lot – sorry, everyone.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to do a special shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/GameNames">GameNames</a>. Very few other people seem to care about it, but I find it debilitatingly hilarious, and have wanted for a long time to make a game based on one of its tweets.</p>
