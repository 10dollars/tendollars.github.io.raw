	<h4>Who are you and what do you do (for a living)?</h4>

<p>Hey! I&#8217;m Wesley Hodgson, and I&#8217;m a UX Designer at Microsoft.</p>

<h4>What is <a href="http://bonernoise.com">Boner Noise</a>?</h4>

<p><a href="http://bonernoise.com">Boner Noise</a> is a little soundboard type site I made that has a few err&#8230; uplifting sound effects that you can play should the mood strike you.</p>

<h4>Where did the idea come from?</h4>

<p>I like things like silly, one-page websites (eg: <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com">dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com</a>), and I get far too much amusement from some soundboard sites like <a href="http://sadtrombone.com">sadtrombone.com</a>. I also like building websites and keeping those skills up to date.</p>

<p>The world definitely needed a website with a boi-oi-oi-oing sound on it, and at the time I hadn&#8217;t played much with HTML5 Audio or media queries, so I registered the domain and got crackin&#8217;. I knew that one of my co-workers at the time, Pablo Rochat, would think the idea was funny, and it&#8217;s always easier to motivate yourself when someone else is involved, so I asked him if he wanted to help with the icon/logo design. His enthusiasm for the idea cracked me up even more, and he totally killed it with the icons/logo. I probably would never have made the time to do it if it weren&#8217;t for him.</p>

<h4>What did you learn making Boner Noise?</h4>

<p>Well, if it wasn&#8217;t obvious already, I learned that while I usually shy away from involving other people in my ridiculous ideas, sometimes it can help you actually act on them. You&#8217;re more likely to do something if you tell people you&#8217;re going to do it! I learned some technical stuff too, but I don&#8217;t actually think that&#8217;s as valuable a lesson.</p>

<h4>What are some of the things you&#8217;d like to do to Boner Noise?</h4>

<p>Hah! What an odd thing to ask! Actually, I do have a couple things I&#8217;d planned, but have never gotten around to (see above). Maybe now that I&#8217;m saying it here, I&#8217;ll actually get around to it. I&#8217;ve meant to convert the icons to SVG, and probably put some sort of &#8216;loading state&#8217; in for between the button press and the sound play (particularly helpful on mobile). I&#8217;ve joked about other sound themes with friends as well, including the obvious bonerfail.com, which I pictured as essentially the dark, flipside of <a href="http://bonernoise.com">bonernoise.com</a>. When I describe that I always picture the &#8220;dark world&#8221; in the game Super Meat Boy.</p>

<p>You know, I think mixing bonernoise.com and Super Meat Boy in an answer may have just made my day.</p>

<h4>Is it obvious that I like typing &#8220;Boner Noise&#8221; and tried to include it in as many questions as possible?</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s Monday morning and I haven&#8217;t finished my first coffee yet, so&#8230; nope! But thanks!</p>
