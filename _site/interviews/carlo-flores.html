	<h4>Who are you and what do you do?</h4>

<p>My name is Carlo Flores and I try to do cool things with computers.  I help lead a team of Software Engineers at <a href="http://edgecast.com">EdgeCast Networks</a> (now Verizon Digital Media Services) as well as co-organize <a href="http://meetup.com/ladevops">LA DevOps</a> and <a href="http://js.la">js.la</a>, two of the best damn meetup groups in Los Angeles.  </p>

<h4>What is EdgeCats?</h4>

<p><a href="http://edgecats.net">Edgecats.net</a> has cat-gifs-as-a-service, because, hey, who doesn&#8217;t need more cat gifs?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really just a little <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> app using <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a>, which is a micro web framework for quickly building sites.  I had never built an Express app before but kept hearing great things about it and loved <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">one of the pieces of software</a> that inspired it.  One of the best things has been that folks out there have actually forked the application and that <a href="https://github.com/matt-">Matt Austin</a>, an old teammate from an old shop, even showed me some bonehead mistakes that caused security on my servers to be compromised.  So I guess it&#8217;s more than just a goofy service because it&#8217;s also been an excuse to learn and try new things.</p>

<h4>Where are all the EdgeCats gifs from? Do you have a collection of your own?</h4>

<p>I don&#8217;t keep a collection of gifs around on a harddrive, so storing them on a webserver was one of the wins of EdgeCats.  Gifs are contributed by the community via pull requests on <a href="https://github.com/flores/moarcats">GitHub</a>, or by excellent gifs linked to me in various chats and Reddit, of course.</p>

<h4>Any normal cat loving person can land on the site and get a cat gif right away, but there&#8217;s actually a surprising amount of functionality built into EdgeCats. You can plug edgecats.net/auto to get a new cat every 60 seconds, or use /random to get a link for a random cat gif. You can even get a list of all cat gifs, or, if you&#8217;re brave, show all the cat gifs at once.</h4>

<h4>Did you set out to make a resource for people building sites to be able to use cat gifs, like <a href="http://placekitten.com/">Place Kitten</a>?</h4>

<p>Yes!  When I first started at EdgeCast we built a testing framework to ensure our software worked as expected.  The first use case for EdgeCats was simple: if all tests pass, our dashboard featured cat gifs.  If any test did not pass, no cat gifs.  It was an effective motivator.</p>

<h4>How did you decide what features to build in? Are there any new features you want to add in the future? Anything you&#8217;re dying to fix?</h4>

<p>All the features have come in based on user need or to allow myself to use cats whenever possible on other projects.  A good one was when EdgeCats got quite a bit of Reddit and Twitter traffic which led to a HUGE amount of bandwidth use.  At that point I brought in EdgeCats.net/meow as a dirty trick to allow cached images and reduce the internet bill.</p>

<h4>Where did netcat come from?</h4>

<p>One of our former designers <a href="https://twitter.com/tianheyang">Tianhe Yang</a> put it together over a day as an homage to Nyan Cat and terminal programs.  Try dragging him around the screen for a hidden feature!</p>

<p>netcat has been used for various parties in various places as well, since the -auto flag on a projector beats old timey hipster style black and white movies any day of the week, but twice on caturdays.</p>

<h4>Are you a domain hoarder? What&#8217;s the best domain you&#8217;ve got sitting idle right now?</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s not totally idle, but I own http://dumbaas.com, which will probably totally be the next big Internetting as a Service.  You should send me angel funding now while you still can.  Or just please don&#8217;t hack it too bad.</p>
