<p>I Had Ten Dollars is going on a brief hiatus. I&#8217;m in Berkeley for the Summer, interning with <a href="http://diy.org">DIY</a>.</p>

<p>I like to plan about three weeks ahead to keep a mix of longer and shorter interviews and keep a relatively even gender balance. Being busy with a new job in a new city, I&#8217;ve been eyeing the end of my runway as it approached thinking, &#8220;I should probably do something about that.&#8221; Now that I&#8217;m here, the thing to do seems to pretty obvious - hang out in San Francisco and do a bunch of craft projects with my friends and co-workers.</p>

<p>I want thank everyone who has participated so far for being so generous with their time and contributing such thoughtful answers. The fact that everyone I&#8217;ve asked has agreed to be interviewed makes me incredibly proud. I&#8217;ve had people I look up to greatly say that they are <em>honored</em> to have their interviews go up on the site, which makes me feel really good about all the wonderful people and projects I&#8217;ve managed to collect in one place, but also - I think - illustrates just how few opportunities many creators have to share their passion projects in any meaningful way.  </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be heading back to Seattle at the end of September, and the timing to restart the series is ideal. I&#8217;m attending <a href="http://2014.xoxofest.com/">XOXO</a> for the second year in mid September and I expect to meet a ton of creative people with exciting side projects to cover.</p>
