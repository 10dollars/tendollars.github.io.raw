<h1>Summer Break '14! Wooooh!</h1>
</div>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2014/jul14/07-17announcement2.aspx">Hello there.</a> Like every schoolchild in America, and also <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/today-tabs-good-news-bad-news-256490">Rusty Foster</a>, I have decided to take some time for myself this summer. Which means I Had Ten Dollars is going on a brief hiatus. I&#8217;m interning with <a href="http://diy.org">DIY</a> in San Francisco right now, and I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn in a short amount of time. Even though the interviewees for the site shoulder the bulk of the work every week, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to continue giving the site the attention it deserves while I&#8217;m here. Expecting someone to volunteer their time to a project while my attention drifts elsewhere is rude, and not in the good way that some teens mean it. (I might 100% be making that up. I have no idea what teens are doing.)</p>

<p>This is probably interesting to no one, but I generally try to stay about three weeks ahead of the site. Being busy with a new job in a new city, I&#8217;ve been eyeing the end of that runway as it approached, thinking, &#8220;I should probably do something about that.&#8221; Now that I&#8217;m here, the thing to do seems to pretty obvious - spend my free time hanging out in San Francisco and do a bunch of craft projects with my friends and co-workers.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone who has participated so far for being so generous with their time and contributing such thoughtful answers. The fact that everyone I&#8217;ve asked has agreed to be interviewed makes me incredibly proud. I&#8217;ve had people I look up to greatly say that they are <em>honored</em> to have their interviews go up on the site, which makes me feel really good about all the wonderful people and projects I&#8217;ve managed to collect in one place, but also - I think - illustrates just how few opportunities many creators have to share their passion projects in a meaningful way. The audience here is admittedly small, but the interactions I&#8217;ve seen come out of the site are overwhelmingly positive, and I look forward to picking the project up again in October.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be heading back to Seattle at the end of September, and the timing to restart the series then is ideal. I&#8217;m attending <a href="http://2014.xoxofest.com/">XOXO</a> for the second year in mid September and I expect to meet a ton of creative people with exciting side projects to cover.</p>

<p>Okay, have a nice summer. Byeeeeee!</p>
