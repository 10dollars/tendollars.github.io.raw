      <h2>About</h2>
<p>First thing's first. This site is heavily indebted to <a href="https://twitter.com/waferbaby">Daniel Bogan</a>, whom I've never met, but who was generous enough to post <a href="https://github.com/waferbaby/usesthis">the code</a> for his interview site, <a href="http://usesthis.com">The Setup</a>, on GitHub. Thanks, Daniel!</p>

<p>My name is <a href="http://twitter.com/spladow">Thomas Dunlap</a>, and I'm a designer and <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/ms">HCDE masters</a> student living in Seattle, WA. I Had 10 Dollars started as a <a href="https://twitter.com/spladow/statuses/325064162009051136">joke I made on Twitter</a> about the domain ihadtendollars.com being the most descriptive name for most of the sites I'd make. As soon as I posted the tweet, I registered ihadtendollars.com despite the fact that I had no idea what I'd do with it. It sat gathering dust for over a year before I figured out that I wanted to use it to show off side projects that my friends and other awesome people were making. </p>

<p>I love weird art projects and single serving sites. I also love niche communities and projects designed to scratch their creator's own peculiar itch. I'm not exactly sure what this site will be yet, but I know I want it to be a place where a small in joke can have a home next to a relatively big project that could make a go at being a full time gig for a crafty developer.<p>

<p>I think it might be helpful to see what it looks like when someone is testing an hypothesis, or just making an excuse to learn a new tool. Some of these projects will be done by incredibly talented people working at huge companies while others will be done by hobbyists who are just getting started, and I think there might be something positive about putting their work side by side too. If nothing else, the web is a <a href+"http://torrez.org/how-about-some-fucking-whimsy.html">delightful place full of whimsy,</a> and I'd like to shine a light on that.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can always reach me on <a href="http://twitter.com/spladow">Twitter</a>. I also answer email at <a href="mailto:whatscene@gmail.com">whatscene@gmail.com</a>. Feel free to send me cool projects I should know about. :)</p>
