#### Who are you and what do you do for a living?

#### How long have you been playing music for others?

#### Did It Might Get Personal start as a result of Mule's podcast network? Was it something you were working on beforehand?

#### How do you think a song changes between when someone sings onstage versus to a single person, and where do you think performing for the podcast falls? On the one hand, your guest is performing for you in the room, but on the other hand, it's going to be broadcast to lots of people.

#### Do you have a sense of how your guests have found the experience? Are there any themes in their reactions?

#### How do you see the wrap-up video fitting into the project? Can you talk a bit about the importance of the interview to the project and what you think makes a great It Might Get Personal interview?

#### How did you decide on the video podcast format? I don't know a lot about the podcast scene, but it seems like video podcasts often get short shrift when it comes to podcasting apps on iOS. Some don't support them at all. Did you worry about that when you were starting?

#### Over the fourteen interviews I've done so far for this site, I don't think I've ever covered how a project is supported financially. You don't have company sponsors -- you've chosen to use tugboat to get support from your community. What effect, if any, do you think that has on the show?

#### You were your own guest for the last episode, what was the experience of being on the other side of it like?

#### The last post was posted at the end of September, but recorded on August 15th and you said you were going to be taking a break and figuring out how to try some new things. Have you been on break long enough to know what some of those new things are? Can you share some of the things you're excited to try?
