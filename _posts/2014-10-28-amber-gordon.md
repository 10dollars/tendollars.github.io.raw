Hey Amber! Sorry, I think I had some trouble getting at some of my questions

#### Who are you and what do you do for a living?

#### What is Femsplain?

#### Did you look to other publications or writers for inspiration? I initially thought of Lady Bits when I heard about Femsplain, but it's not really centralized; and the monthly theme and open call made me think about 24 Hour Mag, but you'll be releasing content regularly instead of in issues.

#### How did you settle on the idea of themed months? Have you and your editors been having fun building that themed editorial calendar?

#### It seems like you've put a lot of effort into emphasizing that Femsplain is a place for any woman to be heard. The submission guidelines are quite open, even allowing for screenshots of text threads. I was wondering if you've struggled at all between maintaining quality and making sure people who might not normally have a chance to be heard, or aren't as experienced writing still get included.

#### I guess I'm really asking about how curated it will be.

#### What do you think the biggest opportunity for Femsplain is? Like, what is the impact you'd most like to have? It seems like there's a real need for a space for women to share stories with each other just to know that many people experience the same things, but there's also a need to show men what you experience. I'm starting to get a better sense of it thanks to things like blogs devoted to okcupid messages or places like the creepy pm's sub-reddit. But I still have moments where my mind has to stretch to understand just how often those type of messages come in.

#### Do you see Femsplain as being skewed in either of those directions? Am I totally off the mark?
