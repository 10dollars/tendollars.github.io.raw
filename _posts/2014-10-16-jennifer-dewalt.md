summary: A Site A Day

### Who are you, and what do you do for a living?

### How did you decide you were going to make 180 sites in 180 days? How much experience coding did you have before the beginning?

### It seems like one of the biggest barriers for a project like this is generating enough ideas. How did you decide what you were going to build on any given day?

#### For projects like these I always wonder whether it's a strict one a day process. Did you ever work in easier projects to get give you time to do multi day big things? Did you ever have to switch projects because you wouldn't meet your deadline?

### What do you think makes the one-a-day method so compelling, as opposed to say five a week?

### What was the most popular site you built?

### What is your favorite, or the most meaningful one to you?

### What were the biggest lessons you learned over the course of the project? Were there any major surprises?

### A lot of the sites seem to retain the last session. Talking dude, displays the text that was last put in by someone (when I visited it said "fuck on," for example, and most of the drawing ones I saw have past doodles that can be wiped or built on top of.) Is that a conscious decision on your part because you think that interaction is interesting, or was it the easiest way for you to build them?

### This project concluded over a year ago, how have things been going since then? Do you still quickly build sites for fun?
